              <h2>Omg! Cobain killed his killer</h2>
              <p>Following a tour stop at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany, on March 1, 1994, Cobain was diagnosed with bronchitis and severe laryngitis. He flew to Rome the next day for medical treatment, and was joined there by his wife, Courtney Love, on March 3, 1994. The next morning, Love awoke to find that Cobain had overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol. Cobain was immediately rushed to hospital, and spent the rest of the day unconscious. After five days in the hospital, Cobain was released and returned to Seattle.</p>

              <h2>Bitcoin smashed $10 000</h2>
              <p>Is it a bubble doomed to pop or it is still not too late to invest? The reality is that Bitcoin has cracked the symbolic mark of $10,000 (which I mentioned a few weeks ago). This was a critical level for the crypto king, which is attracting millions of investors. The value of the currency has risen more than 800% since the start of the year. Only this month, it is nearly up 71.25%, while from its November low it is nearly up 94.53%. Numbers like these put the monthly performance of SP and NASDAQ to shame (1.22% and 1.07% respectively). Talking about market capitalization, Bitcoin’s market easily exceeds that of Disney, IBM, McDonald or GE.</p>

              <h2>Bitcoin accepted as an alternative to Ukraine's hryvnia</h2>
              <p>New legislation introduced in Ukraine would bring the local cryptocurrency ecosystem under the oversight of the country's central bank.
The bill, first filed on October 6 according to public records, outlines the rules for exchange services, including taxation and data redemption requirements. Notably, the bill calls for cryptocurrencies to be taxed as a kind of property, mirroring the approach taken by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which released a similar determination in 2014.</p>

              <h2>Meet the iPhone X</h2>
              <p>The iPhone X, pronounced "iPhone 10," was introduced at Apple's September 2017 event as a classic "One more thing..." addition to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus product lineup. According to Apple, the iPhone X represents the biggest technological leap forward since the original iPhone was introduced 10 years ago in 2007, and it sets the path for the next decade of iPhone development.</p>

              <h2>Minimalism in all</h2>
              <p>So what is this minimalism thing? It’s quite simple: to be a minimalist you must live with less than 100 things, you can’t own a car or a home or a television, you can’t have a career, you must live in exotic hard-to-pronounce places all over the world, you must start a blog, you can’t have children, and you must be a young white male from a privileged background.

OK, we’re joking—obviously. But people who dismiss minimalism as some sort of fad usually mention any of the above “restrictions” as to why they could “never be a minimalist.” Minimalism isn’t about any of those things, but it can help you accomplish them. If you desire to live with fewer material possessions, or not own a car or a television, or travel all over the world, then minimalism can lend a hand. But that’s not the point.</p>

              <h2>Ukraine joined the European Union</h2>
              <p>Relations between the European Union (EU) and Ukraine are shaped through the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement and also by the Eastern Partnership and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) of the EU. The EU is seeking an increasingly close relationship with Ukraine, going beyond co-operation, to gradual economic integration and deepening of political co-operation.[1] Ukraine is a priority partner within the ENP and forms a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) with the EU.</p>
