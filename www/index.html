              <h2>Omg! Cobain killed his killer</h2>
              <p>Following a tour stop at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany, on March 1, 1994, Cobain was diagnosed with bronchitis and severe laryngitis. He flew to Rome the next day for medical treatment, and was joined there by his wife, Courtney Love, on March 3, 1994. The next morning, Love awoke to find that Cobain had overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol. Cobain was immediately rushed to hospital, and spent the rest of the day unconscious. After five days in the hospital, Cobain was released and returned to Seattle.</p>

              <h2>Bitcoin smashed $10 000</h2>
              <p>Is it a bubble doomed to pop or it is still not too late to invest? The reality is that Bitcoin has cracked the symbolic mark of $10,000 (which I mentioned a few weeks ago). This was a critical level for the crypto king, which is attracting millions of investors. The value of the currency has risen more than 800% since the start of the year. Only this month, it is nearly up 71.25%, while from its November low it is nearly up 94.53%. Numbers like these put the monthly performance of SP and NASDAQ to shame (1.22% and 1.07% respectively). Talking about market capitalization, Bitcoinâ€™s market easily exceeds that of Disney, IBM, McDonald or GE.</p>

              <h2>Bitcoin accepted as an alternative to Ukraine's hryvnia</h2>
              <p>New legislation introduced in Ukraine would bring the local cryptocurrency ecosystem under the oversight of the country's central bank.
The bill, first filed on October 6 according to public records, outlines the rules for exchange services, including taxation and data redemption requirements. Notably, the bill calls for cryptocurrencies to be taxed as a kind of property, mirroring the approach taken by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which released a similar determination in 2014.</p>
